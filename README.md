# Google Play Store Analysis – Tableau

## Project Overview

This project analyzes Google Play Store data using Tableau to understand app performance, user ratings, installations, pricing, and update trends.

The main goal was to build an interactive dashboard that converts raw app data into useful insights for understanding which app categories perform better and what factors can be considered while developing or improving an app.

## Requirements

The project was created to answer the following questions:

- Which categories have the highest number of installs?
- Which categories have the highest average ratings?
- What is the distribution of Free and Paid apps?
- Which content rating has the highest number of apps?
- How have app updates changed over time?
- How can these insights help in improving app strategy?

## Tools & Technologies

- Tableau – Data visualization and dashboard development
- Microsoft Excel – Data source and data preparation
- Data Analysis – Aggregation, comparison and trend analysis

## Dataset

The cleaned dataset contains:

- 10,357 app records
- 9,659 unique applications
- 33 categories
- 9,592 Free apps
- 765 Paid apps
- Average rating: 4.19
- Total installs: 146.63 Billion

The dataset includes information such as App, Category, Rating, Reviews, Installs, Type, Price, Content Rating, Genres and Last Updated.

## Dashboard

The dashboard includes:

- Average Rating
- Total App Count
- Average Installs
- Maximum Price
- Free vs Paid apps
- Installs by Category
- Average Rating by Category
- Apps by Content Rating
- Updates Over Time

Interactive filters were also added for App Type, Category and Rating to allow users to explore different segments.

## Challenges Faced

One of the main challenges was preparing the dataset for analysis because it contained missing values and duplicate application records.

Another challenge was selecting the right visualizations to present multiple insights in a single dashboard without making it difficult to understand.

I also had to make sure that fields such as Installs, Rating and Price were correctly handled for analysis.

## Key Insights

- Game has the highest installs with approximately **31.54 Billion**.
- Communication follows with approximately **24.15 Billion** installs.
- Free apps significantly outnumber Paid apps, with **9,592 Free** and **765 Paid** apps.
- The overall average rating is **4.19**.
- Events has the highest average rating among the highlighted categories at approximately **4.44**.
- The **Everyone** content rating has the highest number of applications.
- App update activity increased significantly in the later years of the dataset.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis:

- Developers can study high-install categories such as Games, Communication and Social to understand market demand.
- High installation numbers should not be the only measure of success; ratings and reviews should also be considered.
- A Free or Freemium model can be considered because free apps dominate the dataset.
- Regular updates and improvements based on user feedback can help maintain app quality and user satisfaction.
- Future analysis can include revenue, pricing vs installs, review-to-install ratio and predictive analysis.

## Future Improvements

The project can be improved by adding:

- Revenue analysis
- Price vs Install analysis
- Rating vs Install analysis
- Review-to-Install analysis
- More detailed time-based analysis
- Predictive analysis for app performance
